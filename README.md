### The main types of microservices can be build using Spring Boot:

#### 1. API Gateway Service
  * Acts as a single entry point for all client requests.
  * Performs routing, filtering, and authentication.
  * Commonly built using Spring Cloud Gateway or Zuul.

#### 2. Discovery Service (Service Registry)
  * Keeps track of all running services and their locations.
  * Enables service-to-service communication without hardcoding addresses.
  * Implemented using Eureka Server (Spring Cloud Netflix).

#### 3. Configuration Service
  * Centralizes configuration management for all microservices.
  * Supports dynamic updates and different profiles.
  * Built using Spring Cloud Config Server.

#### 4. Business Logic Services (Domain Services)
  * Contain the core logic for specific business capabilities.
  * Examples: OrderService, UserService, InventoryService.
  * These are your primary functional microservices.

#### 5. Authentication/Authorization Service
  * Handles user login, registration, token generation, and validation.
  * Often uses Spring Security and JWT/OAuth2.

#### 6. Database Service (Data Access Microservices)
  * Encapsulates database operations for a specific domain.
  * Can be separated or integrated with business services.
  * Uses Spring Data JPA, Spring JDBC, etc.

#### 7. Event-Driven / Messaging Microservices
  * Communicate using asynchronous messaging (RabbitMQ, Kafka).
  * Uses Spring Cloud Stream or Spring Integration.

#### 8. Batch or Background Processing Services
  * Designed for long-running or scheduled jobs.
  * Uses Spring Batch or @Scheduled with Spring Boot.

#### 9. Edge/Proxy Services
  * Similar to API Gateway, but may include rate limiting, caching, etc.
  * Can use Spring Cloud Gateway with plugins or filters.

#### 10. Monitoring and Tracing Services
  * Handle observability and logging.
  * Integrated with tools like Sleuth, Zipkin, Prometheus, Grafana.

### Typical Spring Boot Features Used in Microservices:
* @RestController	For building REST APIs.
* Spring Data JPA	For database operations.
* Spring Cloud	For distributed systems support.
* Spring Security	For authentication/authorization.
* Spring Boot Actuator	For health checks and monitoring.
* Spring Retry, Resilience4j	For fault tolerance.

If you're building a microservices architecture using Spring Boot and Spring Cloud, you often create a combination of the above types, depending on your business needs and system complexity.
